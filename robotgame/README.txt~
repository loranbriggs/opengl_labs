# CS550 Foundations of Computer Graphics
## Homework 3
### Loran Briggs


These program have been created, compiled and tested on a **Ubuntu 14.10** computer
using the **g++ compiler** AND **Microsoft Visual Studio 10** on **Windows 7**.

Header guards are included to use the appropriate header files for either
Windows or Linux as you will see at the top of the
header files. If for some reason the header guard does not work for
your machine you can refer to the following website for the appropriate
naming convention for your OS.

http://sourceforge.net/p/predef/wiki/OperatingSystems/

If all else fails you can also comment out the sections labeled `linux headers`
in the two files mentioned above.

If you are compiling with g++ the following command will work:

    g++ *.cpp -o robotgame -lGL -lGLU -lglut

and to execute:

    ./robotgame

If you are using Visual Studio, copy the files into an empty project and
build and run using the gui menu options.

## How To Play
The object of the game is to move the two silver objects to the silver table and
to move the two gold objects to the gold table. Once both objects are on their
appropriate table, the table will flash red to indicate a winning state, do that
for both tables and you are a mighty claw master!

Meanwhile, there are two *baddies*
out to get you. Baddies of course are no match for your claw, to defend yourself
you must attack the baddies with your claw. If you miss the baddies with your claw
and the baddy gets you, you will take damage. Ten damage, and you're dead. Luckly,
you are much stronger than the baddies, the mighty claw only has to hit a baddy
twice to be rid of it forever.

### Controls
To navigate your robot around the room use the `WASD` keys for forward, left, backward,
and right movement. To rotate the robot arm use the `left` and `right` arrow keys. To raise
and lower the claw use the `up` and `down` arrow keys. Lastly, to close the claw use the
`spacebar`. To restart at any time press the `esc` key.
